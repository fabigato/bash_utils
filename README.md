Misc (mostly bash) scripts for different file management tasks

# Testing
the shell scripts uses [shunit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2?tab=readme-ov-file) 
you can simply download the shunit2.sh file and put it in your PATH, but there's a convenient deb package for ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install -y shunit2
```
